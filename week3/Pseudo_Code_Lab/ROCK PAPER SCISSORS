ROCK PAPER SCISSORS
1. Take in one of three choices from two players
2. Know which is value (r,p or s) are greater than the other
3. Check the values given by the players
4. See if one is greater or they match
5. Either tell which player won or if they match and should play again

define players P1 and P2
(prompt) get X and Y from players
(choice) store X and Y

store/set
R = rock
P = paper
S = scissors
	R > S
	R < P
	R = R
	P > R
	P < S
	P = P
	S > P
	S < R
	S = S

check X and Y
if X > Y, then P1 wins
if X < Y, then P2 wins
if X = Y, then tie, repeat


if X = R and Y = R, then P1 and P2 tie, REPEAT
if X = P and Y = P, then P1 and P2 tie, REPEAT
if X = S and Y = S, then P1 and P2 tie, REPEAT
if X = R and Y = S, then P1 WINS
if X = P and Y = R, then P1 WINS
if X = S and Y = P, then P1 WINS
if X = R and Y = P, then P2 WINS
if X = P and Y = S, then P2 WINS
if X = S and Y = R, then P2 WINS
