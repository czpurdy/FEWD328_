Instructions for our Thermostat
1. Store the target temperature in X
2. Set X equal to 72
3. Get the temperature
4. Store the temperature in a variable t
5. If the value of T is less than X, turn on the heater.
6. If the value of T is greater than or equal to X, turn off the heater.
7. Repeat steps 3 through 6 indefinitely.

get x
x = 72
repeat forever
get T
T = get_sensor_reading
if X < T
turn_on_heater
if X > T
turn_off_heater
